Question: What is the elevation range for the area that the eastern sector of the Colorado orogeny extends into?
Thought 1: I need to search Colorado orogeny, find the area that the eastern sector of the Colorado orogeny extends into, then find the elevation range of the area.
Action 1: Search[Colorado orogeny]
Observation 1: The Colorado orogeny was an episode of mountain building (an orogeny) in Colorado and surrounding areas.
Thought 2: It does not mention the eastern sector. So I need to look up eastern sector.
Action 2: Lookup[eastern sector]
Observation 2: (Result 1 / 1) The eastern sector extends into the High Plains and is called the Central Plains orogeny.
Thought 3: The eastern sector of Colorado orogeny extends into the High Plains. So I need to search High Plains and find its elevation range.
Action 3: Search[High Plains]
Observation 3: High Plains refers to one of two distinct land regions:
Thought 4: I need to instead search High Plains (United States).
Action 4: Search[High Plains (United States)]
Observation 4: The High Plains are a subregion of the Great Plains. From east to west, the High Plains rise in elevation from around 1,800 to 7,000 ft (550 to 2,130 m).[3]
Thought 5: High Plains rise in elevation from around 1,800 to 7,000 ft, so the answer is 1,800 to 7,000 ft.
Action 5: Finish[1,800 to 7,000 ft]
Question: Which documentary is about Finnish rock groups, Adam Clayton Powell or The Saimaa Gesture?
Thought 1: I need to search Adam Clayton Powell and The Saimaa Gesture, and find which documentary is about Finnish rock groups.

Observation 2: Adam Clayton Powell is a 1989 American documentary film directed by Richard Kilberg.
The film is about the rise and fall of influential African-American politician Adam Clayton Powell Jr.[3][4] It was later aired as part of the PBS series The American Experience.

Action 3: Finish[The Saimaa Gesture]

Thought 1: I need to search Pavel Urysohn and Leonid Levin, find their types of work, then find if they are the same.
Action 1: Search[Pavel Urysohn]
Observation 1: Pavel Samuilovich Urysohn (February 3, 1898 â August 17, 1924) was a Soviet mathematician who is best known for his contributions in dimension theory.
Thought 2: Pavel Urysohn is a mathematician. I need to search Leonid Levin next and find its type of work.
Action 2: Search[Leonid Levin]
Observation 2: Leonid Anatolievich Levin is a Soviet-American mathematician and computer scientist. 
Thought 3: Leonid Levin is a mathematician and computer scientist. So Pavel Urysohn and Leonid Levin have the same type of work.

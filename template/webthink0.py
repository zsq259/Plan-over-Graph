Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Action, Observation steps. 
Thought can reason about the current situation, and Action can be two types: 
(1) Search[entity], which searches the exact entity on Wikipedia and returns the first paragraph if it exists. If not, it will return some similar entities to search.
(2) Finish[answer], which returns the answer and finishes the task.
For each question, you may have some believable initial informations, you should consider them before you start search.
Here are some examples.
